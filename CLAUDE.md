# Project context

ESP32-S3 / ESP32-C6 firmware for a desk-side Claude Code usage monitor. Each
supported board lives in its own `firmware/src/boards/<name>/` folder and is
selected via PlatformIO's `build_src_filter`. Adding a board means dropping in
a new folder + a new `[env:...]` block — `main.cpp`, `ui.cpp`, and `splash.cpp`
never see board-specific code. See [`docs/porting/adding-a-board.md`](docs/porting/adding-a-board.md).

Eight ports today (two SoC families, six panel sizes, AMOLED + three TFTs, two round):

- `boards/waveshare_amoled_216/` — original Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16 (CO5300, 480×480 square, CST9220 touch, IMU rotation). Build env: `waveshare_amoled_216`.
- `boards/waveshare_amoled_18/` — Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8 (368×448 portrait, XCA9554 IO expander). Build env: `waveshare_amoled_18`. **Two panel revisions are auto-detected at boot** (`board_rev()` in `board_init.cpp`, enum in `board_rev.h`): original = SH8601 display + FT3168 touch (0x38); later = CO5300 display + CST816 touch (0x15). One binary drives both.
- `boards/waveshare_amoled_216_c6/` — Waveshare ESP32-C6-Touch-AMOLED-2.16 (SH8601, 480×480, CST9217 touch). Build env: `waveshare_amoled_216_c6`. ESP32-C6 SoC: single-core RISC-V, **no PSRAM**, BLE 5 only.
- `boards/waveshare_amoled_18_c6/` — Waveshare ESP32-C6-Touch-AMOLED-1.8 (368×448 portrait, SH8601, FT3168 touch, TCA9554 expander). Build env: `waveshare_amoled_18_c6`. Same panel as the S3 1.8 but on the C6 SoC. All subsystems (display, touch, BOOT + PWR buttons, battery, BLE) verified on hardware.
- `boards/waveshare_amoled_206/` — Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.06 (CO5300, 410×502 watch form factor, FT3168 touch, no IO expander, 32 MB flash, PCF85063 RTC, ES8311 codec). Build env: `waveshare_amoled_206`. Display, touch, battery, IMU init, and BLE verified on hardware; the ES8311 chime path is not wired up (`sound.cpp` no-ops).
- `boards/waveshare_lcd_154/` — Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.54 (**ST7789 TFT** over plain 4-wire SPI, 240×240, CST816 touch, no PMU, ES8311 speaker). Build env: `waveshare_lcd_154`. The only non-AMOLED port and the only one below 300 px, which is why `compute_layout()` has a "small" breakpoint.
- `boards/waveshare_knob_18/` — Waveshare ESP32-S3-Knob-Touch-LCD-1.8 (**round** 360×360 ST77916 TFT over QSPI, CST816 touch, rotary ring, DRV2605 haptics, no PMU). Build env: `waveshare_knob_18`. The first round panel (`BoardCaps.is_round` → ring-gauge layout) and the only board with a rotary ring (`has_encoder`).
- `boards/waveshare_lcd_146/` — Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.46 / 1.46B (**round** 412×412 **SPD2010** TFT over QSPI; the same chip is the touch controller on I2C 0x53, TCA9554 gates both resets, GPIO power latch, battery ADC, no PMU). Build env: `waveshare_lcd_146`. The round board with a battery — on round panels the battery icon sits centred in the rings' bottom gap.

**C6 ports have no PSRAM** — shared code gates on `BOARD_HAS_PSRAM` (absent on C6) to use `MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL` for LVGL/splash buffers, and the `screenshot` serial command is disabled (`LV_USE_SNAPSHOT=0`), so UI changes on a C6 board must be eyeballed on hardware, not auto-captured.

The shared code calls a small HAL (`firmware/src/hal/`) that each board implements: display, touch, input, power, IMU. Optional features are guarded by `BoardCaps` (runtime) and `BOARD_HAS_*` (compile-time) rather than `#ifdef BOARD_*`.

Connects to a host daemon over BLE; daemon polls Anthropic API for usage data. This file is for future Claude Code sessions to bootstrap quickly. Read this first.

## Hardware (critical pins)

### AMOLED-2.16 (original)
- Display: **CO5300** AMOLED via QSPI (CS=12, SCLK=38, SDIO0..3=4..7, RST=2)
- Touch: **CST9220** via I2C (SDA=15, SCL=14, INT=11, addr=0x5A)
- PMU: **AXP2101** on same I2C bus (addr=0x34) — battery, USB VBUS, PWR button IRQ
- IMU: **QMI8658** on same I2C bus (addr=0x6B) — accelerometer for auto-rotation
- Buttons: GPIO 0 (left → Space/voice-mode), GPIO 18 (right → Shift+Tab/mode-toggle), AXP PKEY (middle → cycle screens; on splash → cycle animations)

### AMOLED-1.8 (newer port)
**Two hardware revisions ship under this name; the firmware probes I2C at boot and picks drivers automatically (`board_rev()`):**
- Display: **SH8601** (original) or **CO5300** (later rev) AMOLED via QSPI (CS=12, **SCLK=11** ← different!, SDIO0..3=4..7, RST routed via XCA9554 EXIO1). Both are `Arduino_OLED` subclasses held behind one base pointer in `display.cpp`. The CO5300's 368-wide active area starts at GRAM column 16, so it gets `CO5300_COL_OFFSET 16` to center; SH8601 needs none.
- Touch: **FT3168** @ 0x38 (original) or **CST816** @ 0x15 (later rev), via I2C (SDA=15, SCL=14, INT=21). Both expose the same FocalTech-style data layout at regs 0x02..0x06, so one inline reader in `touch.cpp` serves both — only the address differs. Avoids vendoring the GPLv3 `Arduino_DriveBus` library. Revision is detected by which touch address ACKs (CST816 present ⇒ CO5300 panel).
- PMU: AXP2101 @ 0x34 (same chip as 2.16 — `XPowersLib` reused; battery is an optional kit add-on but PMU + charging circuitry are populated)
- IMU: QMI8658 @ 0x6B (same chip — initialized for I2C bus health, rotation logic disabled)
- IO expander: **XCA9554 / PCA9554** @ I2C 0x20. Gates LCD_RST, TP_RST, audio amp enable, and reads the PWR button. **`io_expander_init()` MUST run before `gfx->begin()` or `ft3168_init()`** — otherwise display/touch stay in reset and silently fail. PWR button is on EXIO4, active HIGH (verified empirically with the deleted `iox` serial debug command).
- Orientation: **fixed at 0°**. IMU auto-rotation is disabled; `rotate_strip()` / `handle_rotation_change()` are excluded via `#ifndef BOARD_AMOLED_18`.
- Buttons: GPIO 0 (BOOT → Space/voice-mode), XCA9554 EXIO4 (PWR → cycle screens; on splash → cycle animations). **No third button** (GPIO 18 button doesn't exist on this board).

### AMOLED-1.8 (C6) — `waveshare_amoled_18_c6`
ESP32-C6 sibling of the S3 1.8: same 368×448 SH8601 panel + FocalTech touch, different SoC and GPIO map. **All pins/edges below verified on hardware via temporary GPIO/IRQ scans, since Waveshare's wiki publishes no pin table and the third-party BSP's numbers were partly wrong.**
- Display: **SH8601** AMOLED via QSPI (CS=5, SCLK=0, SDIO0..3=1..4, no MCU reset pin — internal POR; effective reset is the TCA9554 power-cycle). Stock `Arduino_SH8601` init (no vendor-register patch — that's only needed on the C6 2.16).
- Touch: **FT3168** (some units FT6146) @ I2C 0x38, INT=15. Same inline FocalTech reader as the S3 1.8 (regs 0x02..0x06); no reset pin (gated by TCA9554 touch power).
- I2C bus: SDA=8, SCL=7 (shared by TCA9554, AXP2101, FT3168, QMI8658, PCF85063 RTC, ES8311 codec).
- IO expander: **TCA9554 / PCA9554** @ 0x20 — here it gates **power**, not reset: **P4 = display power, P5 = touch power, P7 = audio amp**. `io_expander_init()` runs the documented power-on sequence (P4/P5 LOW → 200 ms → HIGH) and **MUST run before `display_hal_init()`** or the panel stays unpowered. Amp (P7) left off (no audio path).
- PMU: AXP2101 @ 0x34 (owned by `power.cpp`, not `board_init` — LCD isn't on an ALDO rail here).
- IMU: QMI8658 @ 0x6B (init'd for bus health, rotation disabled).
- Orientation: **fixed at 0°**, no rotation (no PSRAM headroom).
- Buttons: **GPIO 9** (BOOT → Space/voice-mode, active LOW — *not* the docs' GPIO 0/9 guess; confirmed by scan), **AXP2101 PKEY** (PWR → cycle screens; on splash → cycle animations). The PKEY **SHORT-press IRQ fires on release** — that's the edge `power.cpp` acts on. No secondary button.

### AMOLED-2.06 (watch form factor) — `waveshare_amoled_206`
- Display: **CO5300** AMOLED via QSPI (CS=12, **SCLK=11** ← same as 1.8, SDIO0..3=4..7, RST=8 direct GPIO). 410×502 portrait. Requires **`col_offset1 = 23`** in the `Arduino_CO5300` constructor — the panel's visible viewport sits at a 22–23 column offset inside the controller's internal RAM. Without it, a vertical strip of stale/garbage content shows through on the right edge (23 was picked empirically for centering; Waveshare's reference library uses 22). The 2.16 dodges this because its 480×480 viewport fills the controller's RAM.
- Touch: **FT3168** via I2C (SDA=15, SCL=14, **INT=38, RST=9** direct GPIO, addr=0x38). Same inline FocalTech reader as the 1.8 port (no GPLv3 `Arduino_DriveBus` dependency). Coordinates verified end-to-end with the BLE reset zone.
- PMU: AXP2101 @ 0x34 (same chip as 2.16/1.8 — `XPowersLib` reused). PWR button routes through AXP PKEY IRQs (short / long / positive), same path as the 2.16 — no IO expander.
- IMU: QMI8658 @ 0x6B (initialized for I2C bus health; rotation logic disabled — fixed watch enclosure orientation).
- RTC: **PCF85063** on the same I2C bus, powered through AXP2101 for retention. Not used by Clawdmeter but present for future features.
- Audio codec: **ES8311** + ES7210 ADC on the same I2C bus. The amp path is unverified on this board, so `sound.cpp` no-ops (same posture as the C6 1.8) — the shared `chime.cpp` engine is ready to wire up once it's tested on hardware.
- **No IO expander** despite the Waveshare wiki FAQ implying one. The schematic shows Key3/PWR wired directly to AXP2101 PWRON; touch reset and display reset are direct GPIOs. `board_init()` pulses LCD_RESET (GPIO 8) and TP_RESET (GPIO 9) before display/touch HAL init.
- Buttons: GPIO 0 (BOOT → Space/voice-mode), AXP PKEY (PWR → cycle screens; hold-to-pair). **No third button**.
- Flash: 32 MB. Uses `default_32MB.csv` partition table.

### LCD-1.54 (TFT) — `waveshare_lcd_154`
Pin map cross-checked against Waveshare's own XiaoZhi board config (`main/boards/waveshare/esp32-s3-touch-lcd-1.54/config.h` in 78/xiaozhi-esp32) — the factory firmware shipped on the unit. Module is ESP32-S3R8: 16 MB quad flash + 8 MB embedded octal PSRAM.
- Display: **ST7789** TFT via 4-wire SPI (CS=21, SCLK=38, MOSI=39, DC=45, RST=40), 240×240, colour inversion on. **Backlight on GPIO 46 via LEDC PWM** — a TFT has no in-panel brightness command, so `display_hal_set_brightness()` is a PWM duty. **Turned a quarter turn left** — `LCD_ROTATION_LEFT` in `board.h` picks GFX rotation 3 (MADCTL MY|MV, free) and `touch.cpp` turns its coordinates back. Rotation 3 reverses the page order, so the 240-row window sits at the far end of the 240×320 GRAM: `row_offset2 = 80` (rotation 0 needs no offsets).
- Touch: **CST816** @ 0x15 (SDA=42, SCL=41, INT=48, RST=47). Same FocalTech-style inline reader as the 1.8 port.
- **No PMU.** Battery % from a 3:1 VBAT divider on GPIO 1 (ADC). **GPIO 2 = BAT_EN power-hold latch** — `board_init()` must drive it HIGH or the board dies on battery; `power.cpp` drops it for the 8 s power-off. **GPIO 3 = charger status, LOW while charging.** VBUS itself is not sensed, so `power_hal_is_vbus_in()` stays false.
- Audio: ES8311 @ 0x18 (I2S MCLK=8, BCLK=9, WS=10, DOUT=12), amp enable GPIO 7. ES7210 mic ADC present, unused.
- IMU QMI8658 and RTC PCF85063 present, unused. Orientation fixed (no auto-rotation) — see the quarter turn left above.
- Buttons (labels printed on the case): **BOOT = GPIO 0** (Space), **PLUS = GPIO 4** (Shift+Tab), **PWR = GPIO 5** (cycle screens, hold-to-pair, 8 s = power off). All plain active-LOW GPIOs; PWR edges are synthesized in software in `power.cpp`.

### LCD-1.46 (round TFT) — `waveshare_lcd_146`
Pins from Waveshare's demo package (Arduino `LVGL_Arduino`, ESP-IDF `ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.46-Test`) checked against the schematic. ESP32-S3R8, 16 MB flash, 8 MB PSRAM (esptool-verified). 1.46 and 1.46B differ only in the cover glass.
- **Power latch = GPIO 7 (`BAT_Control`).** The PWR key only powers the board while held; firmware must drive GPIO 7 HIGH or a battery-powered board dies on release. This is why flashing another board's firmware makes the 1.46 look dead. Raised in `initVariant()` (runs before `setup()`), not `board_init()`, to keep the power-on press short. PWR key reads on **GPIO 6** (`Key_BAT`, active LOW); hold 8 s = latch off + deep sleep.
- Display: **SPD2010** via QSPI (CS=21, SCLK=40, SDIO0..3=46,45,42,41, TE=18 unused), 412×412, stock `Arduino_SPD2010` (its init table matches Waveshare's). **Column windows must start on 4N and end on 4N+3** (`display_hal_round_area`). Backlight LEDC PWM on GPIO 5.
- Touch: the SPD2010's touch half @ I2C 0x53 (SDA=11, SCL=10, INT=4), 16-bit register addresses and a BIOS → CPU → point-mode start-up state machine, ported inline from Waveshare's `Touch_SPD2010.cpp`.
- **TCA9554 @ 0x20**: EXIO1 = touch reset, EXIO2 = LCD reset, EXIO3 = SD CS. `board_init()` pulses both resets before display/touch init.
- Battery: 3:1 divider on GPIO 8. No charger-status line, no VBUS sense.
- PCM5101 speaker DAC (not ES8311 — no chime), QMI8658, PCF85063: present, unused.

### Knob-1.8 (round TFT) — `waveshare_knob_18`
Pins from Waveshare's demo package (`08_LVGL_Test/lcd_config.h`, `04_Encoder_Test`, `03_DRV2605_Test`) checked against the schematic. ESP32-S3R8, 16 MB flash. A second MCU (ESP32-U4WDH) owns classic-BT audio and the second ring encoder; the port never talks to it.
- Display: **ST77916** via QSPI (CS=14, SCLK=13, SDIO0..3=15..18, RST=21), 360×360, only the inscribed circle visible. **Neither of Arduino_GFX's two ST77916 init tables fits this panel** — `display.cpp` carries Waveshare's 181-command vendor table in GFX batch-op form, plus COLMOD 0x55 (esp_lcd set it implicitly). 40 MHz, even-aligned flush regions. **Backlight = LEDC PWM on GPIO 47.** **Mounted 180° (USB-C at the top)** — `LCD_ROTATION_180` in `board.h` sets GFX rotation 2 (MADCTL MX|MY, free) and `touch.cpp` mirrors both axes to match.
- Touch: **CST816** @ 0x15 (SDA=11, SCL=12, INT=9, RST=10), same inline reader as the LCD-1.54.
- **Ring = bidirectional detent switch, not a quadrature encoder**: GPIO 8 pulses LOW once per detent one way, GPIO 7 the other way. Sampled every 3 ms on an esp_timer (Waveshare's `bidi_switch_knob.c` logic); `input_hal_encoder_steps()` hands the count to `main.cpp`, which maps it to the PWR short press in both directions (next/prev animation, brighter/darker).
- Haptics: **DRV2605L** @ 0x5A on the touch bus, ERM open loop + ROM library 1 as in the demo; one click per `input_hal_encoder_steps()` call that returns a turn.
- **No reachable keys.** BOOT (GPIO 0) is on the PCB but inside the closed case, and there is no PWR key. `touch_keys` moves their jobs to the screen: **tap** = toggle screens (after a 300 ms double-tap window), **double tap** = Shift+Tab, **hold** = Space while a host is connected (voice-mode PTT), **hold 3–6 s + release while disconnected** = pair. BOOT still works as Space / hold-to-pair with the case open.
- **No battery gauge**: `BATT_ADC` (GPIO 1) divides the 5 V rail, not the cell. **No chime**: the PCM5100A DAC only has a line-out on the connector and its XSMT mute is driven by the second MCU.

```

If `pio` isn't on PATH: try `~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio` (Linux/macOS pio install) or `brew install platformio` on macOS.

Device path differs by OS: `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS, `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux. Both expose the ESP32-S3 native USB-JTAG (no boot-mode dance needed).

## QA your own UI changes — don't ask the user

The firmware ships a `screenshot` serial command that dumps the LVGL framebuffer. `./screenshot.sh out.png [port]` captures a PNG sized to the active display (480×480 or 368×448). **Use this on every UI iteration** — Read the PNG with the Read tool, verify the change visually, iterate. Script auto-picks the macOS/Linux default port and falls back to pio's bundled Python if pyserial isn't on the system Python.

The boot screen is `SCREEN_SPLASH` and only advances on a physical button press, so a fresh flash will sit on the splash. To screenshot the screen you're actually editing without asking the user to press a button, **temporarily change the default boot screen** in `main.cpp` (search for `ui_show_screen(SCREEN_SPLASH);`) to `SCREEN_USAGE` / `SCREEN_CONTROLLER` / `SCREEN_BLUETOOTH`, do your iteration, then revert before committing.

## Critical gotchas

1. **CO5300 cannot rotate.** Its MADCTL only supports axis flips, not column/row exchange. Rotation is done by **CPU pixel remapping inside `display_hal_draw_bitmap`** in `boards/waveshare_amoled_216/display.cpp`. We use **PARTIAL render mode with strip rotation** (small 480×40 strips, fast). On rotation change → AMOLED brightness flash → force redraw (handled inside `display_hal_tick`).
2. **OPI PSRAM** required: `board_build.arduino.memory_type = qio_opi` in platformio.ini. Without this, `MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM` returns NULL and the screen is black.
3. **pioarduino platform required.** GFX Library for Arduino needs Arduino Core 3.x (`esp32-hal-periman.h`), not the 2.x that standard `espressif32` ships. We pin `pioarduino/platform-espressif32` 55.03.38-1.
4. **LVGL 9 font patching.** `lv_font_conv` outputs LVGL 8 format. Must remove `#if LVGL_VERSION_MAJOR >= 8` guards, drop `.cache` field, add `.release_glyph`, `.kerning`, `.static_bitmap`, `.fallback`, `.user_data`. Without patching, fonts render invisible.
5. **Touch reading is centralized inside each board's `touch.cpp`.** The HAL `touch_hal_read()` is called once per loop from `my_touch_cb`; the board's implementation owns its latched `touch_pressed/x/y` state. Don't call the underlying controller from anywhere else — CST9220's `getPoint()` etc. do a full I2C transaction and concurrent callers consume each other's data.
6. **Even-aligned flush regions.** `display_hal_round_area` (called from `rounder_cb`) is what each board uses to enforce this. Required on CO5300, harmless on SH8601.
7. **Touch axis swap/mirror is per-board.** The 2.16's CST9220 needs `setSwapXY(true)` + `setMirrorXY(true, false)` — applied inside `boards/waveshare_amoled_216/touch.cpp::touch_hal_init()`. New ports apply their own.
8. **LVGL RGB565A8 is planar.** `w*h` RGB565 pixels followed by `w*h` alpha bytes; `data_size = w*h*3`, `stride = w*2`. Use `init_icon_dsc_rgb565a8()` for icons that overlap non-uniform backgrounds (e.g. battery over splash). Lucide source PNGs are black-on-transparent — converter must tint to white or icons render invisible. See `tools/png_to_lvgl.js`.
9. **Per-board pre-init is `board_init()`.** Each board's `board_init.cpp` brings up `Wire` and any reset-gating IO expander BEFORE `display_hal_init()`. Skipping the IO expander release on AMOLED-1.8 leaves SH8601 + FT3168 in reset and they silently fail to probe.
10. **No `#ifdef BOARD_*` in shared code.** The whole point of the refactor — if you're about to add one, you probably want a `BoardCaps` field or a per-board file instead. See `docs/porting/capability-flags.md`.

## Icons

`tools/png_to_lvgl.js <input.png> <symbol> [W_MACRO] [H_MACRO] [--tint=RRGGBB | --no-tint]` converts an alpha PNG to RGB565A8. Default tint is white (`0xFFFFFF`) — necessary for Lucide PNGs. Splice output into `firmware/src/icons.h` and use `init_icon_dsc_rgb565a8()` in ui.cpp. Currently only the 5 battery icons use this format; the rest are still raw RGB565 baked over the panel background, fine because they live inside opaque zones.

## Splash animations

13 × 20×20 pixel-art creature animations sourced from
[claudepix.vercel.app](https://claudepix.vercel.app). Pipeline:

```bash
node tools/scrape_claudepix.js  # → tools/claudepix_data/*.json
node tools/convert_to_c.js      # → firmware/src/splash_animations.h
```

Each animation has a per-animation 10-color RGB565 palette. Cell values 0..9 index it. Default boot screen.

**Second set: the Professor (monkey), 40x40, 16 colours.** Drawn in code by
`tools/monkey/make_monkey.py` (poses = eyes/mouth/brows/arms/props on one base
monkey) → `firmware/src/splash_animations_monkey.h`, GIF previews in
`tools/monkey/preview/` (git-ignored). Picked at build time by
`-DSPLASH_SET_MONKEY` through `splash_set.h`; env `waveshare_lcd_146_monkey`, or
`PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS=-DSPLASH_SET_MONKEY` for any board. A set defines its
own `SPLASH_GRID`/`SPLASH_PALETTE_SIZE`; `splash.cpp` works on any grid. It uses
the stock animation names, so the rotation groups and host-API states map
unchanged — keep new animations on those names. Never hand-edit the header.

## User profile / preferences

See `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` files for persistent context (user is an embedded-beginner senior dev, brand-conscious, prefers iterative UI refinement, dislikes me authoring my own art when third-party assets are intended). Always read those memory files at session start.

## Recent session highlights

- **The board could stop advertising forever (2026-09-12).** Symptom: pairing only worked if the host was started at the same instant as the pairing gesture; wait a few seconds and the board was gone from the host's list. Cause: advertising ends on this hardware without any connect/disconnect of ours (OSes probe HID advertisers and drop them, and a connection that dies during establishment fires no `onConnect`), while the only restarts were `onDisconnect` and `ble_clear_bonds()`. Miss those and the board sat in `state=ADVERTISING, ble_gap_adv_active()=false` indefinitely — logging "advertising start=OK" the whole time. `ble_tick()` now re-checks every 2 s and restarts whenever a connection slot is free (free slot, not zero connections — the OS holds the HID link while the daemon needs the second one). Verified via Windows' `BluetoothLEDevice` enumeration: absent from three consecutive scans before, present in every scan after, and pairing then succeeded first try. **Debugging note:** `NimBLEAdvertising::start()` returning true proves nothing — `isAdvertising()` (`ble_gap_adv_active()`) is the honest one.
- **The pairing hint says when a host is the problem (2026-09-12).** A host that still holds a bond the board no longer has keeps listing the board as paired and keeps failing to connect — Windows says "gekoppelt", the board says "To pair", and nothing reconciles the two. The board does know: `onAuthenticationComplete` sees `bonded=0 enc=0`. `ble_pairing_rejected()` reports that for three minutes after the last failed handshake (cleared by a successful bond and by `ble_clear_bonds()`), and the hint becomes "Pairing failed / the host has a stale key / remove it there, then retry". Diagnosing this on hardware: the serial log shows the failed handshake, and an NVS dump (`esptool read-flash 0x9000 0x5000`) shows whether `clawd/owner` and the `nimble_bond` keys actually exist — on the Knob-1.8 they did not, confirming the board had no bond while the host thought it did.
- **Hold-to-pair now reports its state (2026-09-12).** The gesture used to be blind — `pair_tick()` only wrote to the serial console, so a 3-second hold with a 6-second cut-off had to be timed by feel, and a successful pair looked exactly like no pair at all. `ui_set_pair_state()` (ui.h) drives an overlay that floats above both the usage view and the splash: "Keep holding" → **"Release now to pair"** → "Release and retry" past the window → "Ready to connect" once bonds are cleared (self-clears after 2 s). The splash paints straight to the panel on the PSRAM-less boards, so it consults `ui_pair_overlay_active()` the same way it already consults `charge_anim_is_active()`. The sound HAL gained `sound_hal_play_pair_armed()` / `sound_hal_play_paired()` — synthesized beeps via the new `chime_play_cue()` (no extra PCM in flash) on the ES8311 boards, no-ops elsewhere. **The Knob-1.8's DRV2605 was tried and dropped:** the driver is healthy (DEVICE_ID 7, auto-calibration passes, real back-EMF measured) but nothing it plays is perceptible — every ROM effect and constant full-amplitude RTP drive, at both the stock ~3 V clamp and the 5.4 V maximum, went unnoticed on hardware. The motor is too small for the knob's mass. Pairing feedback there is the overlay alone; the ring's detent click stays. Touch-driven pairing (Knob) gets the same feedback through a new nullable `UiTouchKeys.hold_tick`, fed by LVGL's `LONG_PRESSED_REPEAT`.
- **AMOLED-1.8 chime verified on hardware + EXIO2 touch-kill fix (2026-07-13).** The 1.8's `amp_enable` hook drove both GPIO 46 and XCA9554 EXIO2 ("the unused one is harmless") — but pulling EXIO2 low takes the FT3168 off the I2C bus (chip stops ACKing; IDF reports it as `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`, which reads like a driver wedge and cost a long I2S red-herring chase). Amp enable is GPIO 46 only; EXIO2 must stay HIGH. Chime, touch, buttons, and BLE bond persistence all verified on a real 1.8.
- **Device-abstraction refactor (2026-05-18).** All board-conditional code moved out of shared files into `boards/<name>/` and behind a HAL in `hal/`. ~30 `#ifdef BOARD_*` blocks went to zero. UI is responsive via `compute_layout()` driven by `board_caps()`. New ports add a folder + a PlatformIO env — no shared file edits.
- Added second board port: Waveshare AMOLED-1.8 (368×448 portrait, SH8601, FT3168, XCA9554 IO expander).
- Migrated from Panlee SC01 Plus (480×320 IPS) to Waveshare 2.16" AMOLED (480×480 square). Full hardware/library swap.
- Added IMU auto-rotation, battery indicator, USB-state-aware screen switching.
- Added splash screen with scraped pixel-art animations and 3-button physical input layout.
- Fonts and icons re-scaled ~1.9× for the higher-DPI panel.
- All UI margins widened to 20px to clear the rounded display corners.
- Battery icons converted to RGB565A8 alpha so they blend cleanly over the splash animations.

## Daemon / host side

Bash daemon (`daemon/claude-usage-daemon.sh`) reads OAuth token, polls Anthropic API, sends JSON over BLE GATT. Run with `systemctl --user start claude-usage-daemon`. The unit file's `ExecStart` is the absolute path to the script — repoint it when switching between the worktree and the main checkout.

**Discovery & resilience:**

- Connects by name (`"Clawdmeter"`) on first run, caches resolved MAC at `~/.config/claude-usage-monitor/ble-address`. ESP32 BLE addresses are factory-burned per-chip, so swapping any board invalidates the cache.
- **Boards advertise `Clawdmeter <last 2 MAC bytes>`** (e.g. `Clawdmeter 35F9`), set in `ble_init()` — without it every board announced the same name and a daemon bonded to one would connect to another and drop it in a loop, which is exactly what was seen with two boards on the desk. Name matching is therefore a **prefix** match everywhere: `startswith` in the macOS path, `-like 'Clawdmeter*'` in the Windows PnP query, `grep` in the bash daemon. Don't tighten any of them back to equality.
- **Several boards paired with one host** (Windows): `discover_bonded_addresses()` returns *every* match and `acquire_target()` walks them, advancing on each failed attempt and staying put after a successful one. It used to return the first PnP row, which let one powered-off board retry forever while a reachable one sat beside it — two hours of `TimeoutError` in the field. A `device = F629` line in the config sorts the preferred board first without hiding the others, so a typo degrades to "wrong order", not "no device". **`CLAWDMETER_BLE_ADDRESS` beats all of it** — a stale value there is invisible from the log's point of view and was the actual cause of that field incident.
- On connect failure: cache is dropped AND device is removed from bluez (`bluetoothctl remove`) so the next scan won't re-pick a dead MAC. Multi-candidate scans pick `head -1` and let the failure cycle converge.
- `POLL_INTERVAL=60`, `TICK=5`. Inner loop wakes every 5s to detect disconnects fast; polls Anthropic when 60s elapsed OR when ESP fires a refresh request.

**Local host API (Windows daemon, 2026-09-29).** `daemon/host_api.py` serves `http://127.0.0.1:47280` so another app (yggshell) picks the device's animation without opening BLE itself — the daemon stays the only writer. VITI-shaped *app* role: `POST /api/status {"status":busy|call|away|focus|free|off}` or `{"anim":…}` claims for 90 s, `/api/keepalive`, `/api/release`, `GET /api/status` (link, battery via 0x2A19, usage, `shown`). A claim change is written at once (last reading resent with the new `"a"`), not at the next poll. Bearer key in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Clawdmeter\api-key`. **Client reference: [`docs/host-api.md`](docs/host-api.md)** — keep it in step with the code, and `host_api.ANIMATIONS` in step with `splash_animations.h` (a test enforces the latter).

**GATT characteristics on service `4c41555a-...0001`:**

- `...0002` RX — daemon writes JSON usage payload here.
- `...0003` TX — firmware notifies ack/nack (daemon doesn't subscribe).
- `...0004` REQ — firmware fires `0x01` notify in `onSubscribe` if `has_received_data` is false. Daemon subscribes via `setsid bash -c "stdbuf -oL dbus-monitor … | awk …"`; awk drops a flag file the inner loop picks up. See the `feedback_dbus_monitor_pipe` memory for the three subtle gotchas (pipe buffering, busctl-exits race, `wait` blocking on pipeline jobs).
